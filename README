commands:

coverage:compile
coverage:test
coverage:doc

coverage:test and coverage:doc do the same, so that if you coverage:package-doc, you get your coverage report packaged.

docDirectory is reused for the coverage report directory

to compile plugin from source put the source in .sbt/project/plugins/project and add the plugin as a dependency in .sbt/project/plugins/build.sbt

don't forget to set the sbt version you're using for your project by editing the sbt-scct/project/build.properties file.
